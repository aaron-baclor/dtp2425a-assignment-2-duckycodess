I have loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you.

The way you drive into the paint and strike fear into your enemies eyes.

Your silky smooth touch around the rim, and that gorgeous jumpshot.

I would do anything for you.

I wish it were possible to freeze time so I would never have to watch you retire.
